# Awesome Flux

> :clipboard: A curated list about Flux's architecture and its implementations.

[![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

# Motivation

Motivation was born while I was writing my bachelor's thesis and couldn't find one place with all contents about Flux, its principles, the differences between MVC, implementations and others. So I decided to create this list to share my studies and resources that I found while working on my thesis (the document are avaiable in PT-BR [here](https://github.com/yanmagale/awesome-flux/blob/master/tcc.pdf) only PT-BR).

## Table of contents
